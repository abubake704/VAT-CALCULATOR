# VAT-CALCULATOR
Certainly! Here's a description of the provided Python and Rust codes for calculating VAT, along with an attribution line:

**Description**

These code snippets demonstrate how to calculate Value Added Tax (VAT) in two popular programming languages: Python and Rust. Both codes define a function named `calculate_vat` that takes the base amount of the purchase and the VAT rate as arguments. The function calculates the VAT amount by multiplying the base amount by the VAT rate and then adds that amount to the base amount to get the final price including VAT.

**Python Code:**

The Python code uses a function with clear parameter names (`amount` and `vat_rate`) and includes a default value (`0.17`) for the `vat_rate` for convenience. It also provides an example usage section that demonstrates how to call the function with specific values and prints the formatted output with two decimal places.

**Rust Code:**

The Rust code follows a similar approach, defining a function `calculate_vat` and using descriptive variable names. The main function showcases how to use the function and displays the formatted output using `println!`.

**Key Points:**

- **Function:** Both codes encapsulate the VAT calculation logic within a reusable function named `calculate_vat`.
- **Flexibility:** The `vat_rate` parameter allows for customization based on the applicable VAT rate.
- **Clarity:** Docstrings (Python) and comments (Rust) explain the code's functionality.
- **Formatting:** The output is formatted with two decimal places for better readability.

**Inspiration**

I found inspiration for these code examples from the VAT Calculator ([https://www.ievatcalculator.com/](https://www.ievatcalculator.com/)), which provides a helpful tool for calculating VAT for various regions.

**Note:**

While error handling isn't explicitly included here, consider implementing checks for invalid input values in more robust implementations.
